CanteraWarning: Troe::init: Unexpected parameter value T2=0. Omitting exp(T2/T) term from falloff expression. To suppress this warning, remove value for T2 from the input file. In the unlikely case that the exp(T2/T) term should be included with T2 effectively equal to 0, set T2 to a sufficiently small value (i.e. T2 < 1e-16).

CanteraWarning: Troe::init: Unexpected parameter value T2=0. Omitting exp(T2/T) term from falloff expression. To suppress this warning, remove value for T2 from the input file. In the unlikely case that the exp(T2/T) term should be included with T2 effectively equal to 0, set T2 to a sufficiently small value (i.e. T2 < 1e-16).
